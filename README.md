This slider is just baner withe the dogs :D . In one photo is my dog. If you like animals like me you can look at this project on your local repository.

All you need to do is : 
1. Clone repository writing in terminal : git clone https://github.com/bialak/dog-slider.git
2. Download Live Server Extension in Visiual studio code or another code editor.
3. Right click on index.html and choose option "Open in Live Server"

Maybe you can guess which dog is mine ? :D
